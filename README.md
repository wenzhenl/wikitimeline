## 🤖 AI Development Process

This project showcases the power of AI-assisted development:

- **Architecture & Setup**: Used GPT-4 to design the project structure and choose the tech stack
- **Code Generation**: Leveraged Claude for writing core functionality and components
- **UI/UX Design**: Generated modern UI designs and styling with AI assistance
- **Problem Solving**: Used AI to debug issues and optimize performance
- **Documentation**: Created documentation and comments with AI help

Key learnings from building with AI:

- Start with clear requirements and break them down into smaller tasks
- Use AI to generate boilerplate and complex logic
- Iterate quickly by having AI suggest improvements and alternatives
- Maintain code quality by asking AI to explain and refactor code
- Learn from AI-generated code patterns and best practices
